# Heart-Disease-Prediction-UCI-Dataset
This repository contains an analysis and comparison of various machine learning models to predict heart disease using the UCI dataset.

## Project Overview
- The goal of this project is to evaluate different models' performance based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- The models analyzed include:
  - Neural Network
  - Logistic Regression
  - XGBoost
  - Simplified XGBoost

## Notebooks
- `Heart Disease Prediction UCI Dataset.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
